Compile then run:

    ./load_good_data

Confirm that it works, then run:

    ./load_bad_data

Confirm that nestedOne and nestedTwo have the wrong values (nestedOne has value 2
and nestedTwo has value 1). If the types were different it would result in a crash.

These files both load the same data with different nested field orderings.
